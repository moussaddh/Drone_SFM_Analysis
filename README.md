# **SFM data analysis** 
In this directory we analyse the SFM data coming from 2D images taken with a drone and a handled camera  
on two sahelian species tahat are *Acacia raddiana* and *Faidherbia albida*  
To do so, we use four (4) different tools specified below :   
 
1. [Agisoft MethaShape](https://www.agisoft.com/)
2. [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/)
3. [MatLab ](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
4. [Julia](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 

## **1. Agisoft Metashape analysis steps** 
we use Metahsape to process our images. The main steps for that, after importing images into a single chunk are shown in the chart below :
